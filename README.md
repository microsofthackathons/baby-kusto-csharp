# BabyKusto

Welcome to BabyKusto. BabyKusto is a self-contained KQL (Kusto) engine
with partial support for the [Kusto language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/).

## Example usage

```cs
 // Get your source data from somewhere.
 // Could be from a file on disk, hardcoded in memory, a real database, etc.
ITableSource myTable = /*...*/;

var engine = new BabyKustoEngine();
engine.AddGlobalTable("MyTable", myTable);

var result = engine.Evaluate(@"
    MyTable
    | summarize numSamples = count(),
                v = avg(CounterValue/100)
                by AppMachine");

result.Dump(Console.Out);
```

## Example output from `BabyKusto.Cli`:

```
Welcome to BabyKusto, the little self-contained Kusto execution engine!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

MyTable:
    AppMachine; CounterName; CounterValue;
    ------------------
    vm0; cpu; 50;
    vm0; mem; 30;
    vm1; cpu; 20;
    vm1; mem; 5;
    vm2; cpu; 100;

Query:

let c=100.0;
MyTable
| where AppMachine != 'vm1'
| project frac=CounterValue/c, AppMachine, CounterName
| summarize avg(frac) by CounterName
| project CounterName, avgRoundedPercent=tolong(avg_frac*100)


Result:
    CounterName; avgRoundedPercent;
    ------------------
    cpu; 75;
    mem; 30;
```

## A simple UI that you can upload your csv file and query against it:

To bring up the APP in local, just build the solution, and run dotnet watch run inside the BabyKusto.BlazorApp directory:
