# BabyKusto

BabyKusto is a self-contained execution engine for the [Kusto Query Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/) (KQL). See a [live demo](https://babykusto.azurewebsites.net/).


## How to use

```cs
 // Get your source data.
ITableSource myTable = /*...*/;

var engine = new BabyKustoEngine();
engine.AddGlobalTable("MyTable", myTable);

var query = @"MyTable
              | summarize numSamples = count(),
                          v = avg(CounterValue/100)
                by AppMachine";

var result = engine.Evaluate(query);
if (result is TabularResult tabularResult)
{
    tabularResult.Value.Dump(Console.Out);
}
```

This repo ships with two samples to showcase BabyKusto in action.

* [**BabyKusto.ProcessQuerier**](./samples/BabyKusto.ProcessQuerier): a command-line tool that lets you explore processes running on your machine using KQL. For example, find the process using the most memory with a query like this:
  ```
  Processes
  | project name, memMB=workingSet/1024/1024
  | order by memMB desc
  | take 1
  ```

* [**BabyKusto.BlazorApp**](./samples/BabyKusto.BlazorApp): a web-facing demo that lets you query an arbitrary CSV file using KQL queries. [Live demo](https://babykusto.azurewebsites.net/).


## How it works

BabyKusto leverages the official [`Microsoft.Azure.Kusto.Language`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Kusto.Language/) package for parsing and semantic analysis of KQL queries.

The syntax tree is then translated to BabyKusto's internal representation (see [InternalRepresentation](./src/BabyKusto.Core/InternalRepresentation)), which is evaluated by [BabyKustoEvaluator.cs](./src/BabyKusto.Core/Evaluation/BabyKustoEvaluator.cs).

You can explore the internal representation of a query by setting `dumpIRTree: true` when calling `BabyKustoEngine.Evaluate`.
Below is an example of the internal representation for the query:

```
Processes
| project name, memMB=workingSet/1024/1024
| order by memMB desc
| take 1
```
